This script is a part of JetBrains Academy "Introductory Machine Learning in Python" course. 
Also this is the first time I'm using Classes in projects.

How it works:
- Script asks you to enter sequence of 1 and 0 to learn your typing pattern (other characters will be removed by script).
- After that script asks you to enter another sequence of 1 and 0. Script will try to generate the same sequence.
- Script tries to recreate user input. After that calculates accuracy.
